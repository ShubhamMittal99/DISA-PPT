Also, the level of PM1, PM2.4, PM4 and PM10 pollutants in a large area around the site of such work is very high, jeopardizing the health of all the residents. Hundreds of stone-cutting workers suffer from the incurable disease of Silicosis and the life expectancy is not more than 55 years. The situation is appalling to say the least and it has become no less than a necessity for someone to step forward and take the initiative to put a stop to the problem of silica dust in this industry. As of now, no effective measures are in place to deal with the problem. A simple theoretical solution would be to spray water on the work piece while it is being cut. It would cause the dust to settle down without entering the atmosphere.
